Evaluating the performance of CNN pre-trained model using LIME on [German Traffic and Road Sign Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) framework is used for implementation. Four pre-trained CNN models are used for this experiment. The models are ResNet-34, VGG-19, DenseNet-121 and Inception V3.
